# Design Guidelines: Auto-Generated Blog Platform

## Design Approach
**Reference-Based with System Foundation**
- Primary inspiration: Medium and Substack for content presentation patterns
- Typography-first design prioritizing readability and content hierarchy
- Clean, minimal aesthetic that keeps focus on AI-generated articles
- Professional blog experience with modern web standards

## Typography System

**Font Families:**
- Headlines: Inter or Source Serif Pro (elegant, authoritative)
- Body Text: Georgia or Merriweather (optimized for long-form reading)
- UI Elements: Inter (clean, modern)

**Hierarchy:**
- Article Titles (List): text-2xl md:text-3xl, font-bold
- Article Titles (Detail): text-4xl md:text-5xl, font-bold, leading-tight
- Article Metadata: text-sm, font-medium, muted treatment
- Body Copy: text-lg, leading-relaxed (optimal line-height for reading)
- Captions/Labels: text-sm

## Layout System

**Spacing Primitives:**
- Use Tailwind units: 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24
- Consistent rhythm: p-6 for cards, py-12 md:py-16 for sections, gap-8 for grids

**Container Strategy:**
- Article List: max-w-6xl mx-auto
- Article Detail: max-w-3xl mx-auto (optimal reading width ~65-75 characters)
- Header/Footer: max-w-7xl mx-auto

## Component Library

### Header/Navigation
- Fixed or sticky header with site title/logo (left-aligned)
- Minimal navigation: Home, About (if needed)
- Optional: "AI-Generated Daily" badge/tagline
- Clean, unobtrusive design with subtle bottom border

### Article List View
**Layout:** Vertical stack of article cards with generous spacing (space-y-8)

**Article Card Components:**
- Full-width cards with subtle border or shadow treatment
- Article metadata bar: Generated date, reading time estimate, category/topic tag
- Article title (prominent, clickable)
- Excerpt/preview: First 2-3 lines of content with fade/truncation
- "Read More" affordance (arrow or subtle CTA)
- Hover state: Subtle lift or border color change

**Grid Alternative:** For desktop, consider 2-column masonry layout (grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2) with staggered card heights based on excerpt length

### Article Detail View
**Structure:**
- Article header section: Title, metadata (generation date, reading time), subtle divider
- Article body: Generous margins, optimal line-length, paragraph spacing (space-y-4)
- Article footer: Back to articles link, navigation to previous/next articles
- Typography optimized for long-form reading with clear paragraph breaks

**Reading Experience:**
- Line height: leading-relaxed or leading-loose
- Paragraph spacing: mb-6
- Headings within content: Clear hierarchy with consistent spacing above/below
- Blockquotes (if AI generates them): Distinctive treatment with border-left accent

### Footer
- Minimal footer with: Credits ("Auto-generated by AI"), last generation timestamp, GitHub link
- Optional: Newsletter signup if expanding functionality
- Centered or left-aligned, py-12

### Empty/Loading States
- Skeleton loaders for article cards during fetch
- Empty state: "No articles yet - first article generating soon!" with illustration/icon
- Error states: Friendly message with retry action

## Animations
**Minimal Implementation:**
- Card hover transitions: transform scale-[1.01] or subtle shadow change
- Page transitions: Simple fade-in for content load
- Loading spinners: Subtle, small-scale
- Avoid: Scroll animations, complex transitions, parallax effects

## Responsive Behavior

**Mobile (base):**
- Single column article list
- Full-width cards with p-4
- Reduced typography sizes appropriately
- Comfortable tap targets (min 44px)

**Desktop (md:, lg:):**
- 2-column grid for article list (optional)
- Increased spacing and typography scale
- Wider reading width for article detail (but capped at max-w-3xl)

## Images

**Header/Hero:**
- NO large hero section - this is a content-first blog
- Simple branded header with site title and tagline

**Article Images:**
- Each article card includes a placeholder or AI-generated article illustration (aspect-ratio: 16:9)
- Images positioned above article title in cards
- Article detail view: Optional featured image at top, full-width within content container
- Use object-cover for consistent aspect ratios

**Image Placement:**
```
Article Card: [Image] → [Metadata] → [Title] → [Excerpt] → [Read More]
Article Detail: [Title] → [Metadata] → [Optional Image] → [Body Content]
```

## Brand Elements
- Badge/pill component: "AI-Generated Content" - small, subtle, placed near metadata
- Consistent treatment of timestamps and generation indicators
- Professional, trustworthy aesthetic - not playful or experimental

**Key Principle:** Content is king. Design serves readability and discovery. Every element should enhance the reading experience without distraction.
